## Original Requirements

Develop a robust Cyber Reasoning System (CRS) under the AIxCC Challenge framework, incorporating autonomous identification and remediation of software vulnerabilities for real-time protection. Utilize the MetaGPT GitHub project to automate patch generation, ensuring immediate mitigation of identified vulnerabilities. Implement comprehensive static and dynamic analysis techniques for a thorough real-time examination of software across diverse programming languages. Seamlessly integrate reputable open-source security projects like MISP and Security Onion for enriched real-time threat intelligence and network security monitoring. Craft a robust evaluation and scoring system for real-time monitoring and improvement of CRS performance. Ensure the CRS has a wide range of programming language support to enhance real-time protection across diverse software environments. Outline a commercialization and transition strategy post-AQC for real-world application of CRS, promoting real-time cybersecurity protection. Foster community engagement and open-source collaboration to iteratively improve real-time protection strategies, leveraging collective intelligence and feedback for continuous CRS enhancement. Incorporate structured implementation logic for each feature, ensuring a methodical and well-organized software development process that adheres to best practices and quality standards.
