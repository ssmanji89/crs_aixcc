## Logic Analysis

- ['main.py', 'Main']
- ['vulnerability_detection.py', 'VulnerabilityDetection']
- ['patch_generation.py', 'PatchGeneration']
- ['project_management.py', 'ProjectManagement']
- ['scoring_evaluation.py', 'ScoringEvaluation']
- ['commercialization_transition.py', 'CommercializationTransition']

## Task list

- main.py
- vulnerability_detection.py
- patch_generation.py
- project_management.py
- scoring_evaluation.py
- commercialization_transition.py

## Shared Knowledge


        'main.py' contains the main Flask application and uses the other modules to provide its functionality.
        'vulnerability_detection.py' contains the functionality for detecting vulnerabilities in code.
        'patch_generation.py' contains the functionality for generating patches for vulnerabilities.
        'project_management.py' contains the functionality for managing projects.
        'scoring_evaluation.py' contains the functionality for evaluating vulnerabilities and patches.
        'commercialization_transition.py' contains the functionality for developing a commercialization and transition plan.
    

## Anything UNCLEAR

The requirement is clear to me.
