## Original Requirements

The product is a Cyber Reasoning System (CRS) that autonomously identifies and remedies software vulnerabilities within diverse source code environments. It should be capable of understanding the 25 classes of software weaknesses as identified in MITREâ€™s 2023 Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses report and devise robust defense mechanisms. The CRS should be able to perform both static and dynamic analysis techniques tailored for a range of programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and others. It should also be capable of autonomously generating patches to remedy identified vulnerabilities without removing any intended functionality of the software. The product should have a stringent scoring and evaluation criteria for assessing its effectiveness. A detailed project management and execution plan for developing, testing, and evaluating the CRS within the timeline of the AQC is also required. Finally, a commercialization and transition plan for the CRS technology post-AQC is needed.

## Product Goals

- Develop an autonomous Cyber Reasoning System (CRS) that can identify and remedy software vulnerabilities
- Ensure the CRS can understand and defend against the top 25 software weaknesses
- Create a scoring and evaluation system for the CRS

## User Stories

- As a software developer, I want the CRS to automatically identify vulnerabilities in my code so that I can fix them before deployment
- As a cybersecurity analyst, I want the CRS to understand the top 25 software weaknesses so that it can effectively defend against them
- As a project manager, I need a detailed plan for the development, testing, and evaluation of the CRS so that I can ensure the project stays on track
- As a business owner, I want a commercialization and transition plan for the CRS so that I can effectively bring it to market after the AQC
- As a user, I want the CRS to generate patches for identified vulnerabilities without removing any intended functionality so that my software remains secure and functional

## Competitive Analysis

- Product A: Offers similar vulnerability detection but lacks autonomous patch generation
- Product B: Provides robust defense mechanisms but does not support a wide range of programming languages
- Product C: Has a detailed project management plan but lacks a commercialization and transition plan
- Product D: Supports a wide range of programming languages but does not offer autonomous detection and remediation
- Product E: Has a scoring and evaluation system but does not understand the top 25 software weaknesses
- Product F: Offers autonomous patch generation but lacks a detailed project management plan
- Product G: Understands the top 25 software weaknesses but does not offer robust defense mechanisms

## Requirement Analysis

The product needs to be an autonomous system capable of identifying and remedying software vulnerabilities. It should understand the top 25 software weaknesses and be able to defend against them. The system should support a wide range of programming languages and be able to generate patches for identified vulnerabilities without removing any intended functionality. A scoring and evaluation system, a detailed project management plan, and a commercialization and transition plan are also required.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Ensure the CRS can understand and defend against the top 25 software weaknesses']
- ['P1', 'Create a scoring and evaluation system for the CRS']
- ['P1', 'Develop a detailed project management and execution plan for the CRS']
- ['P2', 'Create a commercialization and transition plan for the CRS technology post-AQC']

## UI Design draft

The user interface should be clean and intuitive, with a dashboard showing the status of the system, identified vulnerabilities, and generated patches. It should also include a section for managing the project and a section for the scoring and evaluation system.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The specific programming languages that the CRS should support are not specified. The details of the scoring and evaluation system are also not clear.
